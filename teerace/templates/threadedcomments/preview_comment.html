{% comment %}
	:next:
	    The page to which the user should be redirected after successfully posting
	    a comment.  This is usually to be used in a hidden input field in a form
	    that tells the view where to go next.

	:form:
	    Either a ``FreeThreadedCommentForm`` or a ``ThreadedCommentForm``, 
	    depending on the type of view.

	:comment:
	    If the parameters in POST validate correctly with the appropriate form, the
	    unsaved comment will be passed in through this variable.
